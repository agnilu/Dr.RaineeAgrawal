                            <p>Laser incontinence treatment is a new revolutionary method that solves incontinence problems (urine leakage). At present, incontinence is a relatively common disorder worldwide that can cause unimaginable psychological harm to the person concerned. Light or moderate urine leakage (incontinence) in women is caused by the weakening of the vaginal mucosa due to a load most often – classical vaginal delivery, however, women without children aren’t an exempt from this.</p>
                            <p>Another source of spontaneous urine leakage is sedentary work, congenital predisposition, ageing and loss of elasticity. Middle and lighter stress incontinence can be solved painlessly, simply and without the need for surgical intervention, using the CO2 FRAXIS GYNOLASER laser device.</p>

                            <p>The process of lightening the skin in intimate areas such as the vagina is commonly called vaginal lightening or genital bleaching. This process of improving intimate beauty among women is becoming popular as it is helping them increase their self-confidence.</p>
                                    <p>Bleaching is a common procedure among women that is used for lightening the hair on their arms, lower back, or the lips. In genital bleaching, the darkened area of the skin is bleached to make it lighter in colour. In this process, the area around inner thighs, the labia majora and the portion around the rectum or anus are treated.</p>

                            <p>Female sexual disorders render many women incapable of achieving an orgasm. A lot of women also experience acute pain during sexual intercourse. This might be due to lack of lubrication or decreased vaginal sensitivity and arousal.</p>

                            <p>Nonsurgical vaginal tightening, also known as vaginal rejuvenation, is a nonsurgical procedure that uses energy-based devices to tighten muscles inside the vagina.</p>
                            <p>As women age, the skin of the vagina loses its elasticity and vitality as collagen fibers become fatigued. Just as cosmetic procedures have been used for decades to improve facial skin and to restore its youthfulness, non-surgical vaginal tightening with Femilift improves the health and vitality of vaginal tissue.</p>
                            <p>Femilift is a laser treatment that utilizes a controlled laser beam, applying concentrated thermal heating to the inner layers of vaginal tissue. The heat induces contraction of collagen and elastin and allows for long-term change by stimulating regeneration of these important proteins. The accuracy of the procedure allows Dr. Rainee total control over the movement and intensity of the laser to ensure maximum comfort for every patient.</p>

                            <p>The vulvar is the outer part of the female genitalia and is quite sensitive to the surrounding environments. Itching, presence of a burning sensation, or pain in this area could indicate vulvar disease. If you experience any abnormality, you should contact your gynecologist. Several infections could affect your vulvar ranging from mild skin infection to cancer of the vulvar.</p>
                            <p>When you visit the gynecologist, a physical exam is performed to identify the severity of your symptoms. Also, a swab or biopsy may be carried out to determine the exact condition. Treatment for diseases of the vulva could be either medication, home remedies, or even surgery. </p>
                            <p>Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection caused by herpes simplex. The disease causes pain, itching, and sores on the vulvar and other parts of the genitalia. Often, there is no cure for genital hers, but a gynecologist could recommend some medications to ease the symptoms.</p>

							<p>Women who are considering this treatment should be at or near a healthy weight and have loose skin tissue along the vaginal lips or labia. We also recommend that you are finished having children, since pregnancy and childbirth can alter your results.</p>
                            <p>Vaginal laxity can cause other problems with health and self-esteem. If you have lost vaginal sensation during intercourse, for example, you may be worried this is causing potential issues in your relationship. A labiaplasty can bring back sensation by improving laxity. </p>

                            <p>As pregnancy progresses, and even after delivery, you may notice changes in your pelvic floor—including leaking when you cough or sneeze or pain during sex—which could be signs of weaker pelvic floor muscles.</p>
							<p>Pelvic floor muscles are often impacted by pregnancy, and childbirth puts considerable pressure on the pelvic floor and can cause issues long after delivery, which can in turn impact its functions and anatomy.</p>
                            <p>Because of the stress pregnancy and delivery can put on the pelvic floor, partaking in pelvic floor strengthening exercises leading up to pregnancy may be beneficial. “Since our pelvic floor muscles are so intertwined functionally with our abdominal muscles, and both are involved in postural support and core strength, the stretching that naturally occurs in the abdomen during pregnancy will put extra demands on your pelvic floor,” explains Dr. Rainee.</p>
