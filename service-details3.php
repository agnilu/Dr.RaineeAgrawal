							<h2>Pap Smear</h2>
							<p>A procedure in which a small brush is used to gently remove cells from the surface of the cervix and the area around it so they can be checked under a microscope for cervical cancer or cell changes that may lead to cervical cancer. A Pap smear may also help find other conditions, such as infections or inflammation.</p>
							<p> It is usually done at the same time as a pelvic exam and may also be done at the same time as a test for certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Also called Pap test and Papanicolaou test.</p>
							<p>A Pap smear, also called a Pap test, is a procedure to test for cervical cancer in women. A Pap smear involves collecting cells from your cervix — the lower, narrow end of your uterus that's at the top of your vagina.</p>

                            <p>PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease) is a medical condition in which the woman ovaries produce immature or partially mature eggs in large numbers and over the time these become cysts in ovaries. Due to this ovaries become large and secrete large amount of male hormones (androgens) causing infertility, irregular menstrual cycles, hair loss and abnormal weight gain. PCOD can be controlled by diet and lifestyle modifications.</p>

						<h2>Vaccine For Cervical Cancer</h2>
							<p>Cervical cancer, mainly caused by Human Papillomavirus infection, is the leading cancer in Indian women and the second most common cancer in women worldwide. Though there are several methods of prevention of cervical cancer, prevention by vaccination is emerging as the most effective option, with the availability of two vaccines.</p>
							<p>Several studies have been published examining the vaccine's efficacy, immunogenicity and safety. Questions and controversy remain regarding mandatory vaccination, need for booster doses and cost-effectiveness, particularly in the Indian context.</p>
							<p>Like other immunizations that guard against viral infection, HPV vaccines stimulate the body to produce antibodies that, in future encounters with HPV, bind to the virus and prevent it from infecting cells.</p>

                            <p>As fertility treatment is a complicated process, counselling is an opportunity for couples to discuss any emotional difficulties, fears and anxieties that they may experience during their journey in becoming parents. Fertility counselling enables couples to talk about their problems and feelings.</p>
                            <p>It may also support couples in helping them to understand the process, especially during critical cycles, such as if IVF treatment has so far been unsuccessful, or in cases where it has worked and they are finding it difficult to adjust to their new lifestyle.</p>
                            <p>Fertility Counselling care provides supportive care for those who have had a miscarriage or pregnancy loss. It can be a time of great sadness and loss for you. It can bring about a mixture of emotions in response to your loss and in anticipation of future pregnancies. Specialist pregnancy loss counselling can provide you with emotional support and help you to understand your grief and to prepare for future pregnancies. </p>

							<h2>Adolescent Healthcare</h2>
							<p>Adolescence is the phase of life between childhood and adulthood, from ages 10 to 19. It is a unique stage of human development and an important time for laying the foundations of good health.</p>
							<p>Adolescents experience rapid physical, cognitive and psychosocial growth. This affects how they feel, think, make decisions, and interact with the world around them. </p>
							<p>To grow and develop in good health, adolescents need information, including age-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education; opportunities to develop life skills; health services that are acceptable, equitable, appropriate and effective; and safe and supportive environments. They also need opportunities to meaningfully participate in the design and delivery of interventions to improve and maintain their health.</p>

                            <p>Menopause is a natural biological process. But the physical symptoms, such as hot flashes, and emotional symptoms of menopause may disrupt your sleep, lower your energy or affect emotional health. There are many effective treatments available, from lifestyle adjustments to hormone therapy.</p>
                            <p>Signs and symptoms, including changes in menstruation can vary among women. Most likely, you'll experience some irregularity in your periods before they end. Skipping periods during perimenopause is common and expected. Often, menstrual periods will skip a month and return, or skip several months and then start monthly cycles again for a few months. Periods also tend to happen on shorter cycles, so they are closer together.</p>
                            <p>Preventive health care as you age may include recommended health screening tests, such as colonoscopy, mammography and triglyceride screening. Your doctor might recommend other tests and exams, too, including thyroid testing if suggested by your history, and breast and pelvic exams.</p>

							<h2>Contraception</h2>
