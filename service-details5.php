                            <p>Breast augmentation known as augmentation mammoplasty, can enhance the body contour of a woman who is unhappy with her breast size. This procedure may also be used to improve the loss of breast volume following pregnancy and nursing. Additionally, the operation may help balance breast asymmetries.</p>
                            <p>it is a cosmetic surgical procedure to increase the breast size and enhance the shape of the breast, typically through the placement of silicone or saline breast implants and sometimes with Fat grafting. From a cosmetic surgeon's perspective, the ultimate goal of breast augmentation is to enhance a patient's breast size.</p>
                            <p>Silicone also called "gel" implants or saline breast implants can be used to augment the size and shape of the breasts. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes to match the anatomy of any patient. Breast implants can be placed above or below the pectoral muscle, and the surgery can involve several different types of incisions.</p>

                            <p>By removing excess, stretched out skin, reshaping the breast tissue, and raising the nipple & areola into a more forward position, a Cosmetic surgeon in India can create a more youthful breast contour. Stretched, large areolae can also be reduced during breast lift surgery, creating an overall better proportioned, natural looking breast.</p>
                            <p>As women age, the breasts lose shape and firmness. The skin gradually loses its elasticity and no longer holds the breasts in a youthful, upright position. Pregnancy, breast feeding, weight gain and loss also add to the tissue burden of loss of skin elasticity.</p>

                            <p>Breast reduction is a cosmetic surgery procedure that reduces the size and weight of large, heavy breasts, helping to create a more aesthetically pleasing breast contour that is better proportioned to a patient's body.</p>
                            <p>It may also improve the overall appearance or shape of the breast and help balance breast asymmetries. Skin, along with breast tissue and fat, are removed to create smaller, shapelier breasts. An added benefit where ptosis (droop) exists is a simultaneous uplift of the nipple areolar complex to a more normal position. The areolae (darker skin which surrounds the nipple) may also be reduced in size and made more symmetric.</p>
                            <p>The physical and emotional pain of having exceptionally large breasts can significantly affect many facets of a woman's life. Aside from physical and emotional pain, excess breast tissue can inhibit an active lifestyle and limit physical activity. Excess weight of the breasts can cause back pain, neck pain, and other bothersome conditions like skin rashes or irritation from the bra strap pressing into the skin.</p>
